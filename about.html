                <div class="aboutpage">It is very important to go to the gym only for yourself, to become <strong>healthy and strong</strong>, to have a healthy mind in a healthy body, and not to just show your body to other people, no matter how beautiful it looks. To sum up, there are different lively public places, where people go to achieve their goals.</div>
                <div class="aboutpage">Exercising is most essential for proper <strong>health and fitness</strong> . Moreover, it is essential for every sphere of life. Especially today’s youth need to exercise more than ever. It is because of the <strong>junk foods</strong>  they consume every day can hamper their quality of life.
        
                    If you are not healthy, you cannot lead a happy life and won’t be able to contribute to the expansion of society. Thus, one needs to exercise to beat all these problems. But, it is not just about the youth but also about every member of the society.
                    
                    These days, physical activities take places in colleges more than often. The professionals are called to the campus for <strong>organizing physical exercises</strong>. Thus, it is a great opportunity for everyone who wishes to do it.
                    
                    Just like exercise is important for college kids, it is also essential for office workers. The desk job requires the person to sit at the desk for long hours without breaks. This gives rise to a very unhealthy lifestyle.
                    
                    They get a limited amount of exercise as they just sit all day then come back home and sleep. Therefore, it is essential to exercise to adopt a <strong>healthy lifestyle</strong> that can also prevent any damaging diseases.</div>
